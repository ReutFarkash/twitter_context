# 📝 Obsidian Chat Summary: Twitter Context Phase 1

## 🎯 Executive Summary
Initialized and implemented the first functional version of the **Twitter Context Manager**. This tool enables rapid context capture from Twitter/X and surfaces that information via visual badges (emojis) on the site.

## 🏗️ Key Achievements
- **Scaffolded Environment:** Set up a Git-tracked workspace with standard meta-files and Assistant vault integration.
- **Capture Loop:** Developed a browser extension that scrapes tweet data (User, Text, URL) and sends it to a local bridge.
- **Bridge Server:** Built a Node.js Express server to handle file I/O, allowing the extension to write and read from the Obsidian vault.
- **CORS Mitigation:** Implemented a background relay architecture to bypass browser security restrictions on localhost communication.
- **Visual Feedback:** Added real-time handle scanning that injects status emojis (🔴🟢🟡) into the Twitter UI based on vault records.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details
- **Repo:** `git@github.com:ReutFarkash/twitter_context.git`
- **Bridge:** Port 3000, handles `POST /save` and `GET /check/:handle`.
- **Vault:** `data_vault/03/Twitter_Context/`
- **Format:** Markdown with YAML metadata + Dataview inline fields `[key:: value]`.

## 📍 Status & Handoff
- **Status:** **Phase 1 MVP Complete.**
- **GitHub:** `c6de095` (Pushed).
- **Latest State:** All core features (Capture + Badge) are verified working.
